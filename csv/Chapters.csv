0,0,Background,imgs/sea level rise.jpg,Source: Our World,https://ourworld.unu.edu/en/sea-level-rise-is-inevitable-but-we-can-still-prevent-catastrophe-for-coastal-regions,"Since 1880, global sea levels have risen by about 8-9 inches. This number is expected to increase further as sea levels continue to rise, mainly due to the melting of glaciers and sea ice. According to NOAA, global sea levels are projected to rise by 1 foot by the end of the century. While a 1-foot increase may not seem substantial, it will lead to the erosion of beaches and an increased risk of flooding globally. Nearly 30% of the U.S. population, according to the United States Census, resides in densely populated coastal areas. Given the coastal population and the rate of sea level rise, it is vital that we understand the scope of the ongoing problem.",10.0,Hidden,,"Rodanthe, NC",35.5956105,-75.4707948,,0.9,,

While a popular destination for tourists, being a coastal area makes it highly vulnerable to the risks of sea level rise. The motivation to specifically analyze Dare County arose from articles highlighting beach homes being claimed by the ocean. Notably, the community of Rodanthe has striking images of houses nearly submerged in the ocean, still visible on Google Maps. The projects objective was to examine Dare County and analyze the changes in coastlines since 2017.",10.0,Hidden,,"Dare County, NC",35.5956105,-75.4707948,,,geojson/clipped_globe.geojson,
2,2,Comparing Coastlines,imgs/Shoreline.png,,,"The map on the right illustrates two distinct coastlines: one from 2017 and the other from the current year, 2023. While not uniformly consistent in all areas, there is an apparent recession of the current coastline compared to its position in 2017. Its important to acknowledge that the coastlines were traced by hand, introducing the potential for human error and rendering them less than entirely accurate. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to observe the scale of the recession over this relatively short period, likely attributed to both sea level rise and beach erosion. The area most significantly impacted appears to be the beaches facing the Atlantic Ocean.",10.0,Hidden,,"Dare County, NC",35.5956105,-75.4707948,,,geojson/clipped_shoreline17.geojson,
3,3,Impacts,imgs/residential.png,,,"We understand that sea level rise and erosion will lead to the loss of land, but what is the impact on us? Dare County is predominantly situated on barrier islands, positioned between the Atlantic Ocean and the sound. Consequently, most communities on the island are at risk. The map highlights residential parcels in red, revealing that out of 78,009 parcels in Dare County, 30,849 are designated for residential use. This equates to 30,849 plots of land intended for people to live on. Considering that many individuals share homes with family or roommates, this represents a substantial population potentially facing displacement. These displaced individuals must find new places to live, potentially placing a burden on other areas with an influx of people. This pattern is observable globally, with estimated coastal migration ranging from 17 to 72 million people by 2100.",10.0,Hidden,,"Dare County, NC",35.5956105,-75.4707948,,,,

There are numerous options, each with its own drawbacks. Some potential mitigation tactics include constructing new infrastructure, modifying land use, or employing shoreline maintenance practices. While practices like constructing levees or seawalls can be effective, they also come with the drawback of altering or removing beaches. Protecting wetlands by modifying land use can be beneficial, but this approach may not be suitable for coastal beaches. Another option is to implement various shoreline maintenance practices, such as using breakwaters to reduce erosion or creating dunes to protect the coast. However, these options are likely to be expensive to implement. The future is likely to vary depending on the coastal area, but adapting to our changing world will require a combination of efforts.",10.0,Hidden,,"Dare County, NC",35.5956105,-75.4707948,,,,
