0,0,Background,imgs/sea level rise.jpg,Source: Our World,https://ourworld.unu.edu/en/sea-level-rise-is-inevitable-but-we-can-still-prevent-catastrophe-for-coastal-regions,"Since 1880 global sea level has risen by about 8-9 inches globally. This number is only expected to increase as sea levels continue to rise. The rise has mostly been due to the melting of glaciers and Seas ice. According to NOAA, global sea level is expected to rise by 1 foot by the end of the century. While 1 foot may not seem like much the increase globally will erode beaches and enhance the risk for flooding. According to the United States Census almost 30% of the U.S. population live in densely populated coastal areas. Given the population on the coast and the rate of sea level rise, it is vital that we understand the scope of the problem that we will continue to face.",10.0,Hidden,,"Rodanthe, NC",35.5956105,-75.4707948,,0.9,,

Dare County is incredibly popular for tourists, but being a coastal area it is highly vulnerable to the risk of sea level rise. The initial inspiration for analyzing Dare County specifically came about when articles about beach homes being taken by the ocean surfaced. One community in particular, Rodanthe, has striking images of houses almost completely in the ocean. These images can still be seen on Google Maps. The purpose of the project was to look at Dare County and analyze the change in coastlines since 2017.",10.0,Hidden,,"Dare County, NC",35.5956105,-75.4707948,,,geojson/clipped_globe.geojson,
2,2,Comparing Coastlines,imgs/Shoreline.png,,,"The map on the right shows two separate coastlines. One coastline is from 2017 and the other is current, 2023. While not consistent in all areas it appears that the current coastline has receded from where it was in 2017. It is important to note that coastlines seen were traced by hand. Because the coastline is not entirely accurate and would suffer from human error. However it is still noteworthy the scale of the recession in such a short period of time. This was likely due both to sea level rise and beach erosion. The area with the greatest impact appears to be the beaches facing the Atlantic Ocean.",10.0,Hidden,,"Dare County, NC",35.5956105,-75.4707948,,,geojson/clipped_shoreline17.geojson,
3,3,Impacts,imgs/residential.png,,,"We know there will be sea level rise and erosion resulting in loss of land, but how does it impact us? Dare county exists almost entirely on barrier islands. This means that the islands are situated between the Atlantic ocean and the sound. Most communities on the island will be affected. As seen on the map the parcels that are identified as residential are highlighted in red. In total there are 78,009 parcels in Dare County, of the 78,009 parcels 30,849 are residential. That means that 30,849 plots of land are designated for people to live in. Given that many people share homes with family or roommates, that is a lot of people that could be displaced. And those people have to move somewhere which could burden other areas with an influx of people. This trend is something that can be seen across the world. The estimated coastal migration ranges from 17 to 72 million people by 2100.",10.0,Hidden,,"Dare County, NC",35.5956105,-75.4707948,,,,
4,4,What can be done?,imgs/Adaptation.png,Source: Coastal Structures as Beach Erosion Control and Sea Level Rise Adaptation in Malaysia: A Review,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/13/13/1741,"So, What do we do to mitigate the effects of sea level rise? There are many options  that could help each with their own downsides. Some potential mitigation tactics include constructing new infrastructure, modify land use, or use shoreline maintenance practices. Practices like constructing levees or seawalls can be effective but they also alter or remove beaches. Modifying land use by protecting wetlands can help but that doesnt work for coastal beaches. Another option is to implement different shoreline maintenance practices such as breakwaters to reduce erosion or create dunes to protect the coast, but the options are likely expensive to implement. Likely our future will vary depend on the coastal area but it will take a combination of efforts to adapt to our changing world",10.0,Hidden,,"Dare County, NC",35.5956105,-75.4707948,,,,
